## ORM(Object Relational Mapping)

ORM tools allow developers to interact with databases using object-oriented programming paradigms rather than writing low-level SQL queries. This can make database programming more intuitive and less error, as well as allowing developers to work more efficiently and quickly.

ORM tools provide features like automatic database schema generation, query building, and caching, which can help optimize application performance. Common ORM tools include Hibernate for Java, Django ORM for Python, and Entity Framework for .NET.
